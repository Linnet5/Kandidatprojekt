# Virtual Trainer

A small project gamifying exercise. Virtual Trainer lets you take a virtual pet with you as you go through levels of exercises. Your exercise data is tracked by recording gyro and accelerometer data, which is evaluated at the end of each exercise. Compete against yourself and try to reach a perfect score for each exercise.

At the end of each level, you might encounter a new friend to bring with you on your next workout. Exercise with them and they will become stronger just like you.

*(This project was developed as a bachelor project for Media Technology students at Linköping University. The game is not fully fledged with many different exercises, but rather at a proof of concept stage with only one exercise implemented. The project is scalable, and new exercises could be added by recording them into the reference database).*
